### 0.1.6 - 2018-09-28
- property `actionInitiated` is now of type `number` which is incremented when the `create`, `close` 
action on an entity is under process and decremented when the action completes (succeeeded or failed).

### 0.1.5 - 2018-09-27
- Improved log statements for better debugging.
- Any type of `error` event will be emitted with a tick delay. This would give enough time for the 
`create()` methods to resolve the promise.
- Added a new `boolean` property `actionInitiated` which indicates whether the `create`, `close`
action on an entity is under process.

### 0.1.4 - 2018-09-25
- `options` is a required property of `Connection` and `Container`.

### 0.1.3 - 2018-09-25

- Ensure that `container.createConnection()` creates a connection on that container and not on 
the default container.
